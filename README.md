# RTSAgentCombat
* Motivation 

     This is Real Time Strategy(RTS) framework for handling agent combat using Unity Machine Learning.
     The project is aimed to developper and researchers who work on the field of RTS combat(MicroManagement).

* Why Using Unity ML as research platform for Real Time Strategy Games ?

     As I am preparing a PHD in RTS Micronagement games, I decided to create this framework. There are already platform available for researcher for developping algorithm using Machine learning for Real Time Strategy games but some are very difficult to get in while Unity ML is easy to set up and it can be used by anyone also you create your code from scratch. So you can have more control of thing that happens.
     Also Unity ML provide functionnality to handle Multi Agent scenario and curriculum learning. So Using Unity ML gives huge benefits to researchers who works on RTS field.
