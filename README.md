# RTSAgentCombat

Motivation

The project is aimed to developer and researched who works on the field of RTS combat(MicroManagement).
This is Real Time Strategy(RTS) framework for handling agent combat using Unity Machine Learning.

There are already platform available for researcher for developping algorithm using Machine learning for Real Time Strategy games but
some are very difficult to get in.
So As I am preparing a PHD in RTS Micronagement games, I decided to create this framework.
